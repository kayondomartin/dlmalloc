 * [PROG]: Red Black Tree
 * [AUTHOR]: Ashfaqur Rahman <sajib.finix@gmail.com>
 * [PURPOSE]: Red-Black tree is an algorithm for creating a balanced
 *   binary search tree data structure. Implementing a red-balck tree
 *   data structure is the purpose of this program.
 * 
 * [DESCRIPTION]: Its almost like the normal binary search tree data structure. But
 *   for keeping the tree balanced an extra color field is introduced to each node.
 *  This tree will mantain bellow properties.
 *  1. Nodes can be either RED or BLACK.
 *  2. ROOT is BLACK.
 *  3. Leaves of this tree are null nodes. Here null is represented bya special node NILL.
 *     Each NILL nodes are BLACK. So each leave is BLACK.
 *   4. Each RED node's parent is BLACK
 *  5. Each simple path taken from a node to descendent leaf has same number of black height. 
 *     That means each path contains same number of BLACK nodes.
